	abstract = {The notion of cancer as a complex evolutionary system has been validated by in-depth molecular analyses of tumor progression over the last years. While a complex interplay of cell-autonomous programs and cell-cell interactions determines proliferation and differentiation during normal development, intrinsic and acquired plasticity of cancer cells allow for evasion of growth factor limitations, apoptotic signals, or attacks from the immune system. Treatment-induced molecular selection processes have been described by a number of studies already, but understanding of those events facilitating metastatic spread, organ-specific homing, and resistance to anoikis is still in its early days. In principle, somatic events giving rise to cancer progression should be easier to follow in childhood tumors bearing fewer mutations and genomic aberrations than their counterparts in adulthood. We have previously reported on the genetic events accompanying relapsing neuroblastoma, a solid tumor of early childhood. Our results indicated significantly higher single nucleotide variants in relapse tumors, gave hints for branched tumor evolution upon treatment and clonal selection as deduced from shifts in allelic frequencies between primary and relapsing neuroblastoma. Here, we will review these findings and give an outlook on dealing with intratumoral heterogeneity and sub-clonal diversity in neuroblastoma for future targeted treatments.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Protein interactions are fundamental building blocks of biochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions. The complexity and functionality of such systems emerge not from the protein interactions themselves but from the dependencies between these interactions. Therefore, a comprehensive approach for integrating and using information about such dependencies is required. Results: We present an approach for endowing protein networks with interaction dependencies using propositional logic, thereby obtaining protein hypernetworks. First we demonstrate how this framework straightforwardly improves the prediction of protein complexes. Next we show that modeling protein perturbations in hypernetworks, rather than in networks, allows to better infer the functional necessity of proteins for yeast. Furthermore, hypernetworks improve the prediction of synthetic lethal interactions in yeast, indicating their capability to capture high-order functional relations between proteins. Conclusion: Protein hypernetworks are a consistent formal framework for modeling dependencies between protein interactions within protein networks. First applications of protein hypernetworks on the yeast interactome indicate their value for inferring functional features of complex biochemical systems.},

	abstract = {Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, and accounts for ∼15\% of all childhood cancer deaths. The histone demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A, previously known as LSD1), is strongly expressed in neuroblastomas, and overexpression correlates with poor patient prognosis. Inducing differentiation in neuroblastoma cells has previously been shown to down regulate KDM1A, and siRNA-mediated KDM1A knockdown inhibited neuroblastoma cell viability. The microRNA, miR-137, has been reported to be downregulated in several human cancers, and KDM1A mRNA was reported as a putative target of miR-137 in colon cancer. We hypothesized that miR-137 might have a tumor-suppressive role in neuroblastoma mediated via downregulation of KDM1A. Indeed, low levels of miR-137 expression in primary neuroblastomas correlated with poor patient prognosis. Re-expressing miR-137 in neuroblastoma cell lines increased apoptosis and decreased cell viability and proliferation. KDM1A mRNA was repressed by miR-137 in neuroblastoma cells, and was validated as a direct target of miR-137 using reporter assays in SHEP and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated KDM1A knockdown phenocopied the miR-137 re-expression phenotype in neuroblastoma cells. We conclude that miR-137 directly targets KDM1A mRNA in neuroblastoma cells, and activates cell properties consistent with tumor suppression. Therapeutic strategies to re-express miR-137 in neuroblastomas could be useful to reduce tumor aggressiveness.},

	abstract = {In many cancer types, MYC proteins are known to be master regulators of the RNA-producing machinery. Neuroblastoma is a tumor of early childhood characterized by heterogeneous clinical courses. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is a marker of poor patient outcome in this disease. Here, we investigated the MYCN-driven transcriptome of 20 primary neuroblastomas with and without MYCN amplification using next-generation RNA sequencing and compared the results to those from an in vitro cell model for inducible MYCN (SH-EP MYCN-ER). Transcriptome sequencing produced 30–90 million mappable reads for each dataset. The most abundant RNA species was mRNA, but snoRNAs, pseudogenes and processed transcripts were also recovered. A total of 223 genes were significantly differentially expressed between MYCN-amplified and single-copy tumors. Of those genes associated with MYCN both in vitro and in vivo, 32\% of MYCN upregulated and 37\% of MYCN downregulated genes were verified either as previously identified MYCN targets or as having MYCN-binding motifs. Pathway analyses suggested transcriptomal upregulation of mTOR-related genes by MYCN. MYCN-driven neuroblastomas in mice displayed activation of the mTOR pathway on the protein level and activation of MYCN in SH-EP MYCN-ER cells resulted in high sensitivity toward mTOR inhibition in vitro. We conclude that next-generation RNA sequencing allows for the identification of MYCN regulated transcripts in neuroblastoma. As our results suggest MYCN involvement in mTOR pathway activation on the transcriptional level, mTOR inhibitors should be further evaluated for the treatment of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.},

	abstract = {Objective
Current predictive biomarkers for PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1)/PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1)-directed immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mostly focus on features of tumour cells. However, the tumour microenvironment and immune context are expected to play major roles in governing therapy response. Against this background, we set out to apply context-sensitive feature selection and machine learning approaches on expression profiles of immune-related genes in diagnostic biopsies of patients with stage IV NSCLC.
Methods
RNA expression levels were determined using the NanoString nCounter platform in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies obtained during the diagnostic workup of stage IV NSCLC from two thoracic oncology centres. A 770-gene panel covering immune-related genes and control genes was used. We applied supervised machine learning methods for feature selection and generation of predictive models.
Results
Feature selection and model creation were based on a training cohort of 55 patients with recurrent NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy. Resulting models identified patients with superior outcomes to immunotherapy, as validated in two subsequently recruited, separate patient cohorts (n = 67, hazard ratio = 0.46, p = 0.035). The predictive information obtained from these models was orthogonal to PD-L1 expression as per immunohistochemistry: Selecting by PD-L1 positivity at immunohistochemistry plus model prediction identified patients with highly favourable outcomes. Independence of PD-L1 positivity and model predictions were confirmed in multivariate analysis. Visualisation of the models revealed the predictive superiority of the entire 7-gene context over any single gene.
Conclusion
Using context-sensitive assays and bioinformatics capturing the tumour immune context allows precise prediction of response to PD-1/PD-L1-directed immunotherapy in NSCLC.},

Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference genome independent (‘de novo’) approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs.We present Virus-VG as a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from preassembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is, optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real datasets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.Virus-VG is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/jbaaijens/virus-vg.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.

	abstract = {Proteins in living cells rarely act alone, but instead perform their functions together with other proteins in so-called protein complexes. Being able to quantify the similarity between two protein complexes is essential for numerous applications, e.g. for database searches of complexes that are similar to a given input complex. While the similarity problem has been extensively studied on single proteins and protein families, there is very little existing work on modeling and computing the similarity between protein complexes. Because protein complexes can be naturally modeled as graphs, in principle general graph similarity measures may be used, but these are often computationally hard to obtain and do not take typical properties of protein complexes into account. Here we propose a parametric family of similarity measures based on Weisfeiler-Lehman labeling. We evaluate it on simulated complexes of the extended human integrin adhesome network. We show that the defined family of similarity measures is in good agreement with edit similarity, a similarity measure derived from graph edit distance, but can be computed more efficiently. It can therefore be used in large-scale studies and serve as a basis for further refinements of modeling protein complex similarity.},

However, count statistics on somatic insertions and deletions (indels) discovered so far point out that large amounts of discoveries must have been missed. The reason is that the combination of uncertainties relating to, for example, gap and alignment ambiguities, twilight zone indels, cancer heterogeneity, sample purity, sampling and strand bias are hard to accurately quantify. Here, a unifying statistical model is provided whose dependency structures enable to accurately quantify all inherent uncertainties in short time. As major consequence, false discovery rate (FDR) in somatic indel discovery can now be controlled at utmost accuracy. As demonstrated on simulated and real data, this enables to dramatically increase the amount of true discoveries while safely suppressing the FDR. Specifically supported by workflow design, our approach can be integrated as a post-processing step in large-scale projects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	issn = {1757-9708},
	doi = {10.1039/c8ib00012c},
	abstract = {Protein interactions are fundamental building blocks of biochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions. The complexity and functionality of these systems emerge not only from the protein interactions themselves but also from the dependencies between these interactions, as generated by allosteric effects or mutual exclusion due to steric hindrance. Therefore, formal models for integrating and utilizing information about interaction dependencies are of high interest. Here, we describe an approach for endowing protein networks with interaction dependencies using propositional logic, thereby obtaining constrained protein interaction networks ("constrained networks"). The construction of these networks is based on public interaction databases as well as text-mined information about interaction dependencies. We present an efficient data structure and algorithm to simulate protein complex formation in constrained networks. The efficiency of the model allows fast simulation and facilitates the analysis of many proteins in large networks. In addition, this approach enables the simulation of perturbation effects, such as knockout of single or multiple proteins and changes of protein concentrations. We illustrate how our model can be used to analyze a constrained human adhesome protein network, which is responsible for the formation of diverse and dynamic cell-matrix adhesion sites. By comparing protein complex formation under known interaction dependencies versus without dependencies, we investigate how these dependencies shape the resulting repertoire of protein complexes. Furthermore, our model enables investigating how the interplay of network topology with interaction dependencies influences the propagation of perturbation effects across a large biochemical system.

Here, we showed that US28 increased the malignancy of U251 glioblastoma cells by enhancing signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid that stimulates oncogenic pathways in glioblastoma. US28 expression increased the abundance of the key components of the S1P signaling axis, including an enzyme that generates S1P [sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1)], an S1P receptor [S1P receptor 1 (S1P1)], and S1P itself. Enhanced S1P signaling promoted glioblastoma cell proliferation and survival by activating the kinases AKT and CHK1 and the transcriptional regulators cMYC and STAT3 and by increasing the abundance of cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), driving several feed-forward signaling loops. Inhibition of S1P signaling abrogated the proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of US28. US28 also activated the S1P signaling axis in HCMV-infected cells. This study uncovers central roles for S1P and CIP2A in feed-forward signaling that contributes to the US28-mediated exacerbation of glioblastoma.},

Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components—a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines—to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.},

Global allele frequencies at relapse indicated clonal mutation selection during disease progression. Promoter methylation patterns were consistent over disease course and were patient specific. Recurrent alterations at relapse included mutations in the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma tumor suppressor, chromosome 9p losses, DOCK8 mutations, inactivating mutations in PTPN14 and a relapse-specific activity pattern for the PTPN14 target YAP.

	abstract = {Antibodies targeting the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy, are the standard of care in most patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers. When given before curative surgery, tumor responses and improved event-free survival are achieved. New antibody combinations may be more efficacious and tolerable. In an ongoing, open-label phase 2 study, 60 biomarker-unselected, treatment-naive patients with resectable non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to receive two preoperative doses of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) with or without relatlimab (anti-LAG-3) antibody therapy. The primary study endpoint was the feasibility of surgery within 43 days, which was met by all patients. Curative resection was achieved in 95\% of patients. Secondary endpoints included pathological and radiographic response rates, pathologically complete resection rates, disease-free and overall survival rates, and safety. Major pathological (≤10\% viable tumor cells) and objective radiographic responses were achieved in 27\% and 10\% (nivolumab) and in 30\% and 27\% (nivolumab and relatlimab) of patients, respectively. In 100\% (nivolumab) and 90\% (nivolumab and relatlimab) of patients, tumors and lymph nodes were pathologically completely resected. With 12 months median duration of follow-up, disease-free survival and overall survival rates at 12 months were 89\% and 93\% (nivolumab), and 93\% and 100\% (nivolumab and relatlimab). Both treatments were safe with grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events reported in 10\% and 13\% of patients per study arm. Exploratory analyses provided insights into biological processes triggered by preoperative immunotherapy. This study establishes the feasibility and safety of dual targeting of PD-1 and LAG-3 before lung cancer surgery.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the human genomic small variant calling benchmarking initiative of the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded Next Generation Sequencing Competence Network (NGS-CN) and the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). In this effort, we developed NCBench, a continuous benchmarking platform for the evaluation of small genomic variant callsets in terms of recall, precision, and false positive/negative error patterns. NCBench is implemented as a continuously re-evaluated open-source repository. We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.},

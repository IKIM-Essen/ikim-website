               methods and technology, showing the right data in the context of
               decision support at the point of care becomes an even greater
               challenge. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) modeled in BPMN
               (Business Process Model and Notation) contain evidence-based
               treatment guidance for all phases of a certain diagnosis, while
               physicians need the parts relevant to a specific patient at a
               specific point in the clinical process. Therefore, integration
               of patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) providing
               context to clinicians is needed, which is stored and
               communicated in HL7 (Health Level Seven) FHIR (Fast Healthcare
               Interoperability Resources). To address this issue, we propose a
               method combining an integration of stored data into BPMN and a
               loss-free transformation from BPMN into FHIR, and vice versa.
               Based on that method, an identification of the next necessary
               decision point in a specific patient context is possible. We
               verified the method for treatment of malignant melanoma by using
               an extract of a formalized SOP document with predefined decision
               points and validated FHIR references with real EHR data. The
               patient data could be stored and integrated into the BPMN
               element `DataStoreReference'. Our loss-free transformation
               process therefore is the foundation for combining evidence-based
               knowledge from formalized clinical guidelines or SOPs and
               patient data from EHRs stored in FHIR. Processing the SOP with
               the available patient data can then lead to the next upcoming
               decision point, which will be displayed to the physician
               integrated with the corresponding data.",

  abstract  = "Introduction: The provision of knowledge through clinical
               practice guidelines and hospital-specific standard operating
               procedures (SOPs) is ubiquitous in the medical context and in
               the treatment of melanoma patients. However, these knowledge
               sources are only available in unstructured text form and without
               any contextual link to real patient data. The aim of our project
               is to give a modeled decision support for the next treatment
               step based on the actual data and position of a patient.
               Methods: First, we identified passages for qualified
               decision-making necessary at the point of care from the SOP for
               melanoma. Thereby, the patient-specific contextual reference
               data at decision points was considered in parallel and
               represented by FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource)
               resources. The decision algorithm was then formalized using BPMN
               modeling with FHIR annotations. Validation was provided by
               medical experts, dermatooncologists from University Hospital
               Essen. Results: The resulting BPMN model is presented here with
               the diagnostic procedure of sentinel lymph node excision as the
               example snippet from the whole algorithm. Each decision point is
               edited with FHIR resources covering the patient data and
               preparing the context sensitivity of the model. Conclusion:
               Modeling guideline-based information into a decision algorithm
               that can be presented at the point of care with contextual
               reference, may have the potential to support patient-specific
               clinical decision-making. For patients from a certain status

               cancer in Germany, and the second and third most commonly
               diagnosed cancer in women and men, respectively. In this
               context, evidence-based guidelines positively impact the quality
               of treatment processes for cancer patients. However, evidence of
               their impact on real-world patient care remains unclear. To
               ensure the success of clinical guidelines, a fast and clear
               provision of knowledge at the point of care is essential.
               OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to model
               machine-readable clinical algorithms for colon carcinoma and
               rectal carcinoma annotated by Unified Medical Language System
               (UMLS) based on clinical guidelines and the development of an
               open-source workflow system for mapping clinical algorithms with
               patient-specific information to identify patient's position on
               the treatment algorithm for guideline-based therapy
               recommendations. METHODS: This study qualitatively assesses the
               therapy decision of clinical algorithms as part of a clinical
               pathway. The solution uses rule-based clinical algorithms, which
               were developed based on the corresponding guidelines. These
               algorithms are executed on a newly developed open-source
               workflow system and are visualized at the point of care. The aim
               of this approach is to create clinical algorithms based on an
               established business process standard, the Business Process
               Model and Notation (BPMN), which is annotated by UMLS
               terminologies. The gold standard for the validation process was
               set by manual extraction of clinical datasets from 86 rectal
               cancer patients and 89 colon cancer patients. RESULTS: Using
               this approach, the algorithm achieved a precision value of
               87.64\% for colon cancer and 84.70\% for rectal cancer with
               recall values of 87.64 and 83.72\%, respectively. CONCLUSION:
               The results indicate that the automatic positioning of a patient
               on the decision pathway is possible with tumor stages that have
               a less complex clinical algorithm with fewer decision points
               reaching a higher accuracy than complex stages.",

  abstract  = "The increasing availability of mobile devices and corresponding
               applications, both for providers and patients, often leads to
               speculation that mHealth, as the combination of mobile devices
               and health services is often called, would revolutionize the use
               of information technology (IT) in healthcare. On the other hand
               users, providers and operators providing such solutions are
               often confronted with completely new challenges. This article
               assesses the options and potential of mHealth and also takes a
               critical look at potential obstacles. As this field is very
               broad this critical analysis is illustrated by means of three
               exemplary application areas: mHealth in radiology, the influence
               of mHealth on research and mHealth as an enabler of new
               services, always with examples from other countries.The use of
               mHealth in radiology currently often develops empirically from
               existing applications in a relatively unstructured way and
               benefiting from the dynamic development of mobile technology.
               The possibilities range from viewing images at the bedside via
               mobile accessibility of radiologists up to teleradiology. In
               research there is a huge potential in solutions that actively
               involve patients with their own mobile devices but the field of
               data protection is still perceived in Germany as problematic so
               that only a few research institutions are actively addressing
               these options. The concept of mHealth allows physicians,
               hospitals and other service providers to invent entirely new
               services and a start-up scene is beginning to be established

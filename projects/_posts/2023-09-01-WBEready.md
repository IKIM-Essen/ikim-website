The [WBEready project](https://www.wbeready.de) with the [Institute for Urban Public Health](https://inuph.uk-essen.de/), the [University Hospital Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de), [RWTH Aaachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de]), [EGLV](https://www.eglv.de/) and [FiW](https://www.fiw.rwth-aachen.de/) aims to broaden the use of wastewater based 
methods for public health purposes as well as improving said methods.

## Project aims

### WBE-Catalogue
We will work with clinicians and public health authorities to establish a catalogue of viruses and bacteria to monitor. 

### WBE-Tool Box
We will establish a set of in-vitro and in-silico tools for monitoring the organisms in the catalogue in Wastewater using a both PCR and DNA sequencing based approaches. We will design novel primers for both application types.

### WBE Communications
Establish data exchange and communications tools with the public health authorities.

Working with our colleagues in the [Institute for Urban Public Health]() we will also attempt to include sampling sites inside the sewer system.

### Funding
Funded by the German Ministry for Health (Bundesministerium f√ºr Gesundheit, BMG).

We apply a number of in-vitro techniques (qPCR, genomics) and computational as well as modeling approaches to work towards an early warning system for pathogens beyond SARS-CoV-2. The pathogens include Viruses and Bacteria, for Bacteria we aim at antibiotic resistance genes.
